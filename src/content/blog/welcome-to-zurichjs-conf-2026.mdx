We're thrilled to officially kick off our blog with some infos about **ZurichJS Conf 2026**. The conference is taking place on **September 11th, 2026** at **Technopark Zürich**.

## What to Expect

ZurichJS Conf 2026 brings together **300+ developers**, engineers, and tech enthusiasts for a full day of expert talks, hands-on workshops, and, the best part, networking.

Here's a taste of what's in store:

- **Expert Talks** — Sessions focus on engineering problems and modern production workflows across the web stack. Topics span JavaScript and TypeScript, frontend and backend architecture, performance, tooling, scalability, and maintainability. Some talks are framework-specific, others deliberately framework-agnostic, but all are grounded in real production experience. Expect deep dives into code, design decisions and lessons learned from building and operating large systems, not surface-level trend overviews.
- **Hands-on Workshops** — Workshops are built around practical implementation. You’ll work through guided exercises with real tools, production-style setups, and realistic problem scenarios, often using open-source technologies that power modern web infrastructure. Sessions focus on writing maintainable code, improving workflows, and understanding how decisions play out in real projects. Expect to leave with working examples, reproducible setups, and techniques you can apply directly to your own stack.
- **Networking** — The conference brings together developers from across Europe working in product teams, consultancies, startups, and open-source communities. Conversations revolve around architecture choices, tooling ecosystems, performance trade-offs, and engineering culture. It’s an environment designed for technical exchange, peer learning, and long-term professional connections grounded in shared interest in the open web.

## Call for Papers is Open

We're looking for passionate speakers to share their knowledge. Whether you're a seasoned conference speaker or giving your first talk, we want to hear from you.

[Submit your talk proposal](/cfp) — the CFP is open now and we'd love to see what you've been working on.

## Get Your Tickets

Early bird tickets are available now. Don't miss your chance to be part of the JavaScript event of the year in Switzerland.

## Why we're doing this:

We were asked this at a Meetup in Vienna last week. 'Why are you doing this?' Organising a conference is a huge undertaking! Trust us, we've realised that by now. But here it comes: Big words for a small non-profit, but we genuinely believe it: we want to keep the internet connected, free and innovative. Although these words might sound vague, that's what we're aiming for.
The ecosystem needs places where people can come together in real life. We need to keep talking, learning and geeking out — and having some fun while we're at it doesn't hurt either! New ideas don't emerge when you sit alone at your desk (OK, for some they do, but for most of us that's not the case). We think they emerge when people with different perspectives sit in the same room, challenge each other's assumptions and view problems from different angles.
Our meetups already provide that opportunity, but they often take place after work, when you're tired after a long day, and only last a few hours. We really hope that ZurichJS Conf will be built for something deeper. A day of workshops before the conference lets you fully immerse yourself in a topic with a small group. A community evening provides more opportunities for learning and networking without the pressure of time. Then there's a full conference day to absorb information, make connections, and leave feeling genuinely energised.

That's what we're building. We hope you'll be part of it!
We can't wait to see you in Zurich!
