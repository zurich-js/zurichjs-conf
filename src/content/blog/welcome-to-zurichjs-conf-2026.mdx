We're thrilled to officially kick off our blog with some infos about **ZurichJS Conf 2026** — Switzerland's premier JavaScript conference, taking place on **September 11th, 2026** at **Technopark Zürich**.

## What to Expect

ZurichJS Conf 2026 brings together **300+ developers**, engineers, and tech enthusiasts for a full day of expert talks, hands-on workshops, and world-class networking.

Here's a taste of what's in store:

- **Expert Talks** —Sessions focus on engineering problems and modern production workflows across the web stack. Topics span JavaScript and TypeScript, frontend and backend architecture, performance, tooling, scalability, and maintainability. Some talks are framework-specific, others deliberately framework-agnostic, but all are grounded in real production experience. Expect deep dives into code, design decisions and lessons learned from building and operating large systems, not surface-level trend overviews.
- **Hands-on Workshops** — Workshops are built around practical implementation. You’ll work through guided exercises with real tools, production-style setups, and realistic problem scenarios, often using open-source technologies that power modern web infrastructure. Sessions focus on writing maintainable code, improving workflows, and understanding how decisions play out in real projects. Expect to leave with working examples, reproducible setups, and techniques you can apply directly to your own stack.
- **Networking** — The conference brings together developers from across Europe working in product teams, consultancies, startups, and open-source communities. Conversations revolve around architecture choices, tooling ecosystems, performance trade-offs, and engineering culture. It’s an environment designed for technical exchange, peer learning, and long-term professional connections grounded in shared interest in the open web.
